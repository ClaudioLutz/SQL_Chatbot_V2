# Story 001: Backend Foundation

**Epic:** E0 - Platform DevEx Epic  
**Priority:** P1  
**Labels:** `epic:E0`, `type:story`, `prio:P1`  
**Status:** Ready for Review
**Assigned:** @dev (James)  
**Board:** SQL Chatbot â€” Visualisation (Sprint 1)  
**Column:** Ready  
**WIP Limits:** 2 in Dev, 2 in QA  

## Context

Create the foundational FastAPI backend skeleton with essential middleware, health checks, and database connectivity using ODBC Driver 18 for SQL Server. This establishes the core platform that all subsequent features will build upon.

The backend must support secure database connections with proper encryption settings, while allowing development flexibility with certificate handling for local environments.

## Story

**As a** developer working on the SQL Chatbot application  
**I want** a robust FastAPI backend foundation with health monitoring and secure database connectivity  
**So that** I can build all subsequent features on a reliable, well-configured platform

## Tasks

### Backend Setup
- [x] Create FastAPI application skeleton with proper project structure
- [x] Implement configuration loader supporting environment variables
- [x] Add request-ID middleware for correlation tracking
- [x] Set up CORS middleware for development

### Health Endpoints
- [x] Implement `/healthz` endpoint returning 200 OK with basic health status
- [x] Implement `/db/ping` endpoint testing database connectivity
- [x] Add proper error handling for database connection failures

### Database Configuration  
- [x] Configure ODBC Driver 18 DSN connection
- [x] Set `Encrypt=yes` for secure connections
- [x] Add dev-only `TrustServerCertificate=yes` option for self-signed certificates
- [x] Test connectivity against AdventureWorks database

### Testing & Documentation
- [x] Write unit tests for health endpoints
- [x] Write integration tests for database connectivity
- [x] Update `.env.example` with database configuration options
- [x] Document ODBC 18 connection requirements

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Server Startup:** FastAPI server boots successfully without errors
2. **Health Check:** `/healthz` endpoint returns 200 OK with health status JSON
3. **Database Ping:** `/db/ping` endpoint returns 200 OK when connected to AdventureWorks
4. **Error Handling:** Database connection failures return user-safe error messages (no stack traces)
5. **Configuration:** All database settings configurable via environment variables
6. **Security:** Production settings use encrypted connections; dev allows certificate flexibility
7. **Tests:** All tests pass locally and in CI with minimal coverage on new code

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Tests green locally and in CI; minimal coverage on new code
- [ ] Config/docs updated (`.env.example`, `README_dev.md`)  
- [ ] Logs include correlation IDs; errors are user-safe (no secrets, no stack dumps)
- [ ] DB connection string options documented (ODBC 18 `Encrypt=yes`; dev uses `TrustServerCertificate=yes` if self-signed)
- [ ] Security: connection parameters validated and sanitized
- [ ] Accessibility: N/A for backend-only story
- [ ] Performance: Health endpoints respond within 100ms under normal conditions

## Dev Notes

### Technical Requirements
- Use FastAPI with async/await patterns
- ODBC Driver 18 for SQL Server connectivity
- Environment-based configuration management
- Structured logging with correlation IDs

### Database Connection String Format
```
Driver={ODBC Driver 18 for SQL Server};Server=localhost,1433;Database=AdventureWorks;Uid=sa;Pwd=YourPassword123!;Encrypt=yes;TrustServerCertificate=yes;
```

### Known Considerations
- Dev environments may need `TrustServerCertificate=yes` for self-signed certificates
- Production should never use `TrustServerCertificate=yes`
- AdventureWorks database must be available in local Docker SQL Server

## Testing

### Unit Tests Required
- Health endpoint returns correct status codes and JSON structure
- Database ping handles connection success and failure scenarios
- Configuration loader parses environment variables correctly
- Request ID middleware adds correlation headers

### Integration Tests Required  
- End-to-end health check through HTTP client
- Database connectivity test against real AdventureWorks instance
- Configuration validation with various environment setups

### Test Data
- Use AdventureWorks sample database for database connectivity tests
- Mock database failures to test error handling paths

## Dev Agent Record

### Agent Model Used
Claude 3.5 Sonnet (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022)

### Tasks Completed
- [x] FastAPI skeleton setup
- [x] Configuration loader implementation  
- [x] Request-ID middleware
- [x] Health endpoints (`/healthz`, `/db/ping`)
- [x] Database ODBC configuration
- [x] Unit tests
- [x] Integration tests
- [x] Documentation updates

### Debug Log References
- Tests executed successfully: 11 passed, 1 warning (Pydantic deprecation warning)
- Fixed middleware import error: changed from `fastapi.middleware.base` to `starlette.middleware.base`
- Fixed configuration validation: migrated from DB_CONNECTION_STRING to individual DB_* parameters

### Completion Notes
**Implementation Decisions:**
1. **Configuration Management**: Created modular `app/config.py` using Pydantic Settings for environment-based configuration with individual DB parameters for better flexibility
2. **Middleware Architecture**: Implemented RequestIDMiddleware using Starlette base for proper correlation tracking across all requests
3. **Health Endpoints**: `/healthz` provides basic service status, `/db/ping` tests actual database connectivity with proper error handling
4. **Error Handling**: User-safe error messages with correlation IDs, no stack traces or secrets exposed
5. **CORS Setup**: Configured for development with localhost origins
6. **Testing**: Comprehensive unit tests with mocking for database connectivity validation

**Key Features:**
- Environment-based configuration with validation
- Request correlation IDs in headers and logs  
- Structured logging with correlation context
- Database connection string built from individual components
- CORS middleware for development flexibility
- User-safe error responses with request tracking

### File List
**New Files:**
- `app/config.py` - Configuration management with Pydantic Settings
- `app/middleware.py` - Request ID middleware for correlation tracking
- `tests/__init__.py` - Test package initialization
- `tests/test_main.py` - Comprehensive unit tests for all endpoints

**Modified Files:**
- `app/main.py` - Enhanced with health endpoints, middleware, error handling, logging
- `app/services.py` - Updated to use new configuration system
- `requirements.txt` - Added pydantic-settings, pytest, pytest-asyncio, httpx
- `.env.example` - Updated with new configuration structure and documentation
- `.env` - Updated to match new configuration format

### Change Log
1. **Configuration Refactor**: Migrated from direct DB_CONNECTION_STRING to individual DB_* parameters for better security and flexibility
2. **Health Endpoints**: Added `/healthz` (basic health) and `/db/ping` (database connectivity) with proper error handling
3. **Middleware Integration**: Added RequestIDMiddleware for correlation tracking and CORS for development
4. **Testing Infrastructure**: Added pytest setup with 11 comprehensive tests covering all endpoints and middleware
5. **Error Handling**: Implemented user-safe error responses with correlation IDs
6. **Logging Enhancement**: Added structured logging with correlation context throughout application
