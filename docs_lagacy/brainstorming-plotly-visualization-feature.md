# Brainstorming Session: Plotly Visualization Feature

**Date:** 2025-09-30  
**Session Type:** Interactive Requirements Gathering  
**Facilitator:** Mary (Business Analyst)  
**Participants:** Project Stakeholder  
**Duration:** 30 minutes  

## Session Overview

This brainstorming session explored adding an interactive Plotly-based visualization feature to the existing SQL Chatbot V2 application. The goal was to define requirements, scope, and technical approach for allowing users to create custom charts from their query results.

## User Persona & Context

### Primary User
**Role**: Data Analyst / Product Manager  
**Goal**: Create flexible, programmatic visualizations with direct database connectivity  
**Pain Points**: 
- Wants PowerBI-like analysis capabilities but with more programming flexibility
- Needs direct database connection without manual SQL writing (already implemented)
- Requires custom visualization control beyond standard BI tool templates

### Competitive Context
**Compared to PowerBI**:
- âœ… **Advantages**: Direct DB connection, programmatic flexibility, SQL query generation
- ðŸŽ¯ **Feature Parity Goal**: Interactive visualizations with data exploration
- ðŸš€ **Differentiation**: Lightweight, code-first approach with full customization

---

## Current State Analysis

### Existing System Capabilities
- **Core Platform**: FastAPI backend + vanilla JavaScript frontend
- **Current UI Pattern**: Tab-based interface with "Results" and "Analysis" tabs
- **Data Analysis**: Statistical analysis using skimpy library (implemented)
- **User Base**: Business stakeholders + data analysts
- **Architecture**: Progressive disclosure, clarity-first design philosophy

### Integration Context
The new visualization feature will extend the existing analysis capabilities, complementing the current statistical analysis tab with interactive chart generation.

## Brainstorming Process & Options Explored

### 1. Implementation Approach Options
**Explored Alternatives:**
- Option A: âœ… **Selected** - Add "Visualizations" tab to existing interface
- Option B: Create dedicated /analysis-visual page
- Option C: Modal/overlay approach

**Decision Rationale:** Tab approach maintains consistency with current UX pattern, provides quicker implementation path, and keeps users in familiar interface flow.

### 2. User Experience Flow Options
**Explored Alternatives:**
- Flow A: Column-first selection (pick X, then Y, then chart type)
- Flow B: âœ… **Selected** - Chart-type-first selection
- Flow C: AI-assisted suggestion approach

**Decision Rationale:** Chart-type-first gives users clear intent and control, reduces cognitive load by showing only compatible column combinations, and aligns with user's mental model of "I want to create a bar chart."

### 3. Dataset Size Handling
**Challenge Identified:** Mixed dataset sizes from 100 to 50,000+ rows
**Solution Approach:** âœ… **Selected** - Adaptive performance strategy

## Finalized Requirements

### Functional Requirements

#### FR1: Visualization Tab Integration
- Add "Visualizations" tab alongside existing "Results" and "Analysis" tabs
- Tab only enabled when query results contain visualizable data (â‰¥2 rows, â‰¥1 numeric column)
- Consistent styling and behavior with existing tab pattern

#### FR2: Chart Type Selection
- **Primary Chart Types (MVP):**
  - Scatter Plot (numeric X vs numeric Y)
  - Bar Chart (categorical X vs numeric Y)
  - Line Chart (ordered X vs numeric Y)
  - Histogram (single numeric column distribution)

- **Secondary Chart Types (Post-MVP consideration):**
  - Pie Chart (categorical proportions) - deprioritized per user feedback
  - Box Plot (categorical groups vs numeric values)
  - Heatmap (correlation matrix)

#### FR3: Column Compatibility Logic
- User selects chart type first
- System displays only compatible column combinations
- Clear labeling of column data types (numeric, categorical, datetime)
- Smart defaults with override capability

#### FR4: Adaptive Performance Handling
- **Small datasets** (â‰¤1,000 rows): Full data rendering
- **Medium datasets** (1,001-10,000 rows): Client-side optimization
- **Large datasets** (â‰¥10,001 rows): Server-side sampling with user notification
- Progress indicators for all chart generation

#### FR5: Loading and Error States
- Skeleton chart placeholder during generation
- Progress indicator with estimated completion time
- Error handling for incompatible data or generation failures
- User-friendly messaging for all error conditions

### Non-Functional Requirements

#### NFR1: Performance Targets
- Chart generation: â‰¤3 seconds for datasets â‰¤10,000 rows
- Chart generation: â‰¤8 seconds for datasets >10,000 rows (with sampling)
- Tab switching: â‰¤200ms response time
- Memory usage: â‰¤50MB additional for chart rendering

#### NFR2: Browser Compatibility
- Modern browsers supporting ES6+ and Plotly.js
- Responsive design maintaining usability on tablets
- Graceful degradation for unsupported features

#### NFR3: Data Limits
- Maximum 50,000 rows for visualization (consistent with analysis feature)
- Datasets exceeding limit receive informational message with sampling options
- No additional server memory requirements beyond current analysis feature

---

## Technical Considerations

### Architecture Integration Points

#### Frontend Changes
- Extend existing tab system in `static/index.html`
- Add Plotly.js library (~3MB) - consider CDN vs local hosting
- Enhance state management in `static/app.js` for chart data
- Additional CSS for chart containers and controls

#### Backend Requirements
- New `/api/visualize` endpoint for chart data preparation
- Data sampling/aggregation logic for large datasets
- Column type detection and compatibility logic
- Integration with existing query result storage

#### Performance Strategy
```javascript
// Adaptive data handling pseudocode
if (rows.length <= 1000) {
    // Full data client-side rendering
    renderChart(fullData);
} else if (rows.length <= 10000) {
    // Client-side optimization (decimation, aggregation)
    renderChart(optimizeData(fullData));
} else {
    // Server-side sampling
    const sampledData = await fetchSampledData(chartType, columns);
    renderChart(sampledData);
    showSamplingNotice(rows.length);
}
```

### Technical Design Considerations

**Note**: The following technical concerns were identified during team perspective analysis and will be addressed in detail during the technical design phase:

#### Critical Technical Decisions Required
- **Plotly.js Version & Licensing**: Verify MIT license compatibility, select specific version
- **State Management Architecture**: Define how chart state persists during tab switches
- **API Contract**: Full specification of `/api/visualize` endpoint (request/response schema)
- **Column Type Detection Algorithm**: Explicit logic for numeric, categorical, datetime detection
- **Memory Management**: Research and implement Plotly.js memory leak prevention patterns
- **Browser Support**: Define minimum browser versions (e.g., Chrome 90+, Firefox 88+, Safari 14+)

#### Testing Strategy Requirements
- **Unit Test Coverage**: Minimum 80% for new chart generation code
- **Integration Tests**: Tab interaction, API endpoint, state management
- **Edge Case Scenarios**: NULL values, mixed data types, special characters in column names, very long column names
- **Performance Tests**: Dataset generation strategy for consistent testing across 100, 1K, 10K, 50K rows
- **Regression Tests**: Ensure existing Results and Analysis tabs remain unaffected
- **Accessibility Tests**: WCAG compliance for keyboard navigation and screen readers
- **Cross-Browser Tests**: Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge on desktop and tablet

#### Deferred to Technical Design Phase
All detailed technical specifications will be documented in a separate technical design document before Phase 1 begins.

### Risk Assessment & Mitigation

#### Risk 1: Large Dataset Performance
- **Impact**: High - Could freeze browser with 50K+ row visualizations
- **Mitigation**: Implement sampling at 10K+ rows, server-side aggregation, progressive loading

#### Risk 2: Chart Type Complexity
- **Impact**: Medium - Different chart types have different data requirements
- **Mitigation**: Start with 4 core chart types (MVP), robust column compatibility logic

#### Risk 3: Integration Complexity
- **Impact**: Medium - Adding to existing codebase with state management
- **Mitigation**: Leverage existing patterns, minimal changes to current functionality

#### Risk 4: Memory Leaks
- **Impact**: Medium - Plotly.js can leak memory with dynamic chart creation
- **Mitigation**: Research Plotly.js cleanup patterns in technical spike, implement proper disposal
