# SQL Chatbot POC Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Goals and Background Context

### Goals
- Develop a functional Proof-of-Concept (POC) to demonstrate the viability of a natural language to SQL chatbot.
- Showcase the ability of the GPT-5 model to accurately translate user questions into SQL queries.
- Provide a simple, web-based interface for management to interact with the chatbot.
- Execute queries against a database and display the results in a user-friendly format.

### Background Context
Accessing data from our databases currently requires specialized SQL knowledge, creating a bottleneck for non-technical stakeholders. This project aims to solve this by creating a chatbot that allows users to query data using natural language. This POC will serve as a demonstration to management, illustrating the potential of AI to democratize data access within the organization.

## Requirements

### Functional
1.  **FR1:** The system shall provide a web interface with a text input field for the user to enter a natural language question.
2.  **FR2:** The system shall take the user's natural language question and send it to the GPT-5 API.
3.  **FR3:** The system shall receive a SQL query string from the GPT-5 API.
4.  **FR4:** The system shall connect to a configured SQL Server database.
5.  **FR5:** The system shall execute the generated SQL query against the database.
6.  **FR6:** The system shall display the results of the SQL query in a tabular format on the web interface.
7.  **FR7:** The system shall display the generated SQL query that was used to fetch the results.

### Non Functional
1.  **NFR1:** The application will be developed as a Proof-of-Concept, but the architecture should allow for future extension into a production-ready application.
2.  **NFR2:** The application does not require user authentication or authorization for the MVP.
3.  **NFR3:** The system will initially be configured to use a local SQL Server (AdventureWorks) for development and the production SQL server for the final presentation.

## Epic List
- **Epic 1: Core Chatbot Functionality:** Establish the FastAPI backend, create a simple frontend, integrate with the GPT-5 API, and connect to the SQL database to enable end-to-end natural language querying.

## Epic 1 Core Chatbot Functionality
The goal of this epic is to deliver a fully functional, end-to-end proof-of-concept. It will include a basic user interface to input a question, a backend service to orchestrate calls to the AI model and the database, and a display for the results.

### Story 1.1: Basic Frontend Interface
As a user, I want to see a webpage with a text input field and a "Submit" button, so that I can enter my question.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1.  When I open the application URL, I see a page with a title, a text area, and a button.
2.  I can type a question into the text area.
3.  I can click the "Submit" button.

### Story 1.2: AI Integration
As a user, when I submit my question, I want the application to send it to the GPT-5 service and retrieve the corresponding SQL query.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1.  When the "Submit" button is clicked, the text from the input field is sent to the backend.
2.  The backend makes an API call to the GPT-5 service with the user's question.
3.  The backend successfully receives a SQL query string from the GPT-5 service.
4.  The generated SQL query is displayed below the input field on the webpage.

### Story 1.3: Database Execution and Result Display
As a user, after the SQL query is generated, I want the application to execute it against the database and display the results.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1.  After the SQL query is received from GPT-5, the backend connects to the configured SQL Server database.
2.  The backend executes the SQL query.
3.  The data returned from the query is displayed as a table on the webpage, below the generated SQL query.
4.  If the query fails or returns no data, a user-friendly message is displayed.
