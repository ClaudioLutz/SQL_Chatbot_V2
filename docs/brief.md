# Project Brief: SQL Chatbot POC

## Executive Summary
This project will develop a proof-of-concept (POC) SQL Chatbot to demonstrate the capability of translating natural language questions into SQL queries using the GPT-5 model. The primary goal is to showcase this technology to management. For development, the application will connect to a local SQL Server with the AdventureWorks sample database. For the final presentation, it will be configured to connect to the production SQL server.

## Problem Statement
Management is interested in exploring AI-driven solutions to simplify data access. Currently, retrieving data from databases requires technical knowledge of SQL. This creates a barrier for non-technical stakeholders who need to access data for decision-making. This POC aims to demonstrate a solution that removes this barrier.

## Proposed Solution
We will build a web-based chatbot using a Python FastAPI backend. The user will input a question in natural language. The backend will send this question to the GPT-5 model, which will translate it into a SQL query. This query will then be executed against the configured SQL database. The resulting data table, along with the generated SQL query, will be displayed to the user.

## Target Users
- **Primary User Segment:** Management and other non-technical stakeholders.

## Goals & Success Metrics
- **Business Objective:** Successfully demonstrate the feasibility of a natural language to SQL chatbot to management.
- **User Success Metric:** A user can ask a question in plain English and receive an accurate data table from the database.
- **KPI:** The successful execution of a natural language query that returns the expected result.

## MVP Scope
### Core Features (Must Have)
- **Natural Language Input:** A simple web interface with a text box for users to type their questions.
- **SQL Generation:** Integration with GPT-5 to translate the natural language input into a valid SQL query.
- **Query Execution:** The ability to connect to the local SQL Server and execute the generated query.
- **Result Display:** The results of the query will be displayed in a clear, tabular format, along with the SQL query that was generated.

### Out of Scope for MVP
- User authentication and authorization
- Query history and caching
- Advanced data visualization
- Multi-user support
- Scalability and performance optimizations

## Technical Considerations
- **Backend:** Python with FastAPI
- **Database (Development):** Microsoft SQL Server (AdventureWorks sample database) running in a Docker container.
- **Database (Presentation):** Production SQL Server (read-only access).
- **AI Model:** GPT-5 for natural language processing.

## Constraints & Assumptions
- **Constraints:** This is a POC and is not intended for production use. The focus is on functionality, not on a polished UI or scalability.
- **Key Assumptions:**
    - We have access to the GPT-5 API.
- The AdventureWorks database is set up and accessible locally via Docker for development purposes.
- Read-only access to the production database will be available for the final presentation.
    - The scope is limited to read-only queries.

## Next Steps
- **PM Handoff:** This Project Brief provides the full context for the SQL Chatbot POC. The next step is to create a detailed Product Requirements Document (PRD).
