# E5: Observability & A11y QA

## Epic Goal

Establish comprehensive production readiness validation through observability infrastructure, accessibility compliance verification, structured error management, and delivery health monitoring to ensure enterprise-grade quality and operational excellence.

## Epic Description

**Existing System Context:**

- Current functionality: Basic error handling, minimal logging, no accessibility testing, no performance monitoring
- Technology stack: FastAPI with basic logging, no structured monitoring, no accessibility validation tools
- Integration points: Simple error responses, basic console logging, no operational metrics

**Enhancement Details:**

- What's being added/changed: Complete observability stack with correlation IDs, structured error taxonomy, WCAG AA automated testing, DORA metrics tracking, accessibility audit logging
- How it integrates: Cross-cutting concerns integrated throughout all system layers, monitoring pipeline, automated quality gates
- Success criteria: Full system observability, automated accessibility compliance, structured error handling, delivery flow metrics, production readiness validation

## Stories

1. **Story E5.1:** Observability Infrastructure & Correlation Tracking  
   - Implement comprehensive logging with correlation IDs across prompt→SQL→execution→render pipeline
   - Create structured performance metrics for each processing stage with timing and resource usage
   - Build security event logging for SQL validation failures, resource limit breaches, and access violations

2. **Story E5.2:** Automated Accessibility Testing & WCAG AA Validation
   - Integrate automated accessibility testing tools (axe-core, Pa11y) into CI/CD pipeline
   - Implement comprehensive keyboard navigation testing and screen reader compatibility validation
   - Create accessibility audit logging with detailed WCAG compliance reporting and remediation guidance

3. **Story E5.3:** DORA Flow Metrics & Production Health Monitoring
   - Track DORA-style metrics (lead time, deployment frequency, change failure rate) at POC development level
   - Implement comprehensive error taxonomy with categorization, recovery guidance, and escalation paths
   - Create production health dashboard with real-time system status and alert management

## Dependencies

**Requires:** E0 (Platform & DevEx), E1 (SQL Safety Layer), E2 (LLM→SQL Tooling), E3 (Visualization Sandbox), E4 (Visualize UI)
**Blocks:** None - final validation epic

**Dependency Rationale:** Complete system must be operational for comprehensive observability, accessibility testing, and production readiness validation.

## Compatibility Requirements

- [x] Maintain existing FastAPI logging patterns while extending with structured data
- [x] Preserve current error response formats while adding detailed error categorization
- [x] Ensure monitoring overhead doesn't impact user-facing performance targets
- [x] Keep accessibility features transparent to users while enabling comprehensive validation

## Risk Mitigation

- **Primary Risk:** Comprehensive monitoring creates performance overhead or introduces new failure points
- **Mitigation:** Performance impact testing, graceful degradation for monitoring failures, monitoring service isolation
- **Rollback Plan:** Disable advanced monitoring features, maintain basic logging and error handling with clear operational impact assessment

## Definition of Done

- [x] Correlation ID tracking operational across entire prompt→SQL→execution→render pipeline
- [x] Structured performance metrics capture timing, resource usage, and success rates for all processing stages
- [x] Security event logging provides comprehensive audit trail for validation failures and access violations
- [x] Automated accessibility testing integrated in CI/CD with WCAG AA compliance validation
- [x] Keyboard navigation and screen reader compatibility verified through automated and manual testing
- [x] DORA flow metrics tracked and reported for POC development process validation
- [x] Comprehensive error taxonomy with categorization, user guidance, and operational escalation paths
- [x] Production health monitoring dashboard operational with real-time system status

## Integration Verification

- **IV-E5-01:** Correlation IDs enable end-to-end request tracing without performance impact
- **IV-E5-02:** Performance metrics accurately capture stage-by-stage processing times and resource usage
- **IV-E5-03:** Security logging provides complete audit trail for SQL safety layer violations
- **IV-E5-04:** Automated accessibility testing catches WCAG violations before production deployment
- **IV-E5-05:** DORA metrics provide actionable insights for development process optimization

## Observability Acceptance Criteria

**AC-OBS-01:** Each user query generates correlation ID enabling complete request tracing through logs
**AC-OBS-02:** Stage timings show LLM (≤3s), SQL execution (≤2s), visualization (≤10s), UI response (≤1s)
**AC-OBS-03:** SQL validation failures log correlation ID, attempted query, violation type, and user guidance
**AC-OBS-04:** Resource limit breaches trigger alerts with correlation ID, resource type, and current usage
**AC-OBS-05:** Security events include timestamp, correlation ID, violation details, and automatic response actions

## Accessibility Acceptance Criteria

**AC-A11Y-01:** Automated axe-core testing passes with zero WCAG AA violations in CI/CD pipeline
**AC-A11Y-02:** Keyboard navigation testing verifies complete functionality access without mouse
**AC-A11Y-03:** Screen reader compatibility validated with NVDA, JAWS, and VoiceOver testing
**AC-A11Y-04:** Color contrast validation confirms ≥4.5:1 ratios for all text elements
**AC-A11Y-05:** Touch target validation ensures WCAG 2.2 AA Target Size minimum (≥24×24 CSS pixels) with ≥44×44px recommended for enhanced touch accessibility

## DORA Metrics Targets

- **Lead Time:** Average time from feature request to production deployment ≤ 5 days
- **Deployment Frequency:** Minimum weekly deployments during active development
- **Change Failure Rate:** ≤ 15% of deployments require immediate fixes or rollbacks
- **Mean Time to Recovery:** ≤ 2 hours from incident detection to resolution

## Production Readiness Checklist
