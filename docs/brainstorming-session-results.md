## Reflection & Follow-up

### What Worked Well
- Morphological analysis provided systematic coverage of all implementation aspects
- Building on existing project architecture reduced complexity and increased feasibility
- Component-by-component approach revealed clear dependencies and development sequence
- User's practical insights (pandas describe(), two-page architecture) significantly improved solutions

### Areas for Further Exploration
- **Error Handling Strategies**: How to handle GPT-5 code generation failures, invalid visualizations
- **Performance Optimization**: Caching strategies for repeated data analysis, visualization generation
- **Security Considerations**: Code execution sandboxing, input validation for generated Python code
- **Styling and Branding**: Consistent visual design between data and visualization pages

### Recommended Follow-up Techniques
- **Assumption Reversal**: Challenge assumptions about user workflows to discover alternative interaction patterns
- **Role Playing**: Explore user experience from different stakeholder perspectives (technical vs non-technical users)
- **Constraint Mapping**: Deep dive into technical limitations and security requirements

### Questions That Emerged
- How should the system handle ambiguous data that could support multiple visualization types?
- What fallback mechanisms are needed when automatic chart selection fails?
- Should users be able to customize generated visualizations without coding?
