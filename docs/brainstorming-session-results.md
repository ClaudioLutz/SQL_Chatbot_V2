## Action Planning

### Top 3 Priority Ideas

#### #1 Priority: Two-Page Architecture with Static Controls
- **Rationale:** Provides clean separation between data and visualization, eliminates complex dynamic UI behavior, maintains user choice between auto and custom generation
- **Next steps:** 
  1. Create dedicated visualization page with navbar navigation
  2. Add static "Auto Generate" and "Send" buttons with text input area
  3. Implement chart generation endpoints for both automatic and custom prompts
- **Resources needed:** Frontend developer (2 days), Backend Python developer (1 day)
- **Timeline:** Can be implemented within 1 week

#### #2 Priority: Pandas Data Analysis Integration
- **Rationale:** Enables intelligent visualization selection, leverages powerful existing tools, critical foundation for auto-generation
- **Next steps:**
  1. Modify existing SQL result processing to include pandas analysis
  2. Create data structure for analysis results
  3. Pass analysis to visualization generation
- **Resources needed:** Backend Python developer, pandas expertise
- **Timeline:** 1-2 weeks for robust implementation

#### #3 Priority: GPT-5 Visualization Code Generation
- **Rationale:** Core functionality that enables the entire feature, builds on proven GPT-5 integration patterns. **Critical Note:** The implementation of a secure code execution sandbox is a significant technical challenge with major security implications that must be addressed thoroughly.

As this is for the use of just one data analyst the total security risk is not a concern.

- **Next steps:**
  1. Design and implement a secure, isolated code execution sandbox. This is a prerequisite for any code generation.
  2. Design prompt templates for visualization code generation.
  3. Implement robust error handling and fallback mechanisms for both code generation and execution failures.
- **Resources needed:** AI prompt engineer, Python visualization expert
- **Timeline:** 4-6 weeks for reliable implementation, with a significant portion dedicated to the secure sandbox.

## Reflection & Follow-up

### What Worked Well
- Morphological analysis provided systematic coverage of all implementation aspects
- Building on existing project architecture reduced complexity and increased feasibility
- Component-by-component approach revealed clear dependencies and development sequence
- User's practical insights (pandas describe(), two-page architecture) significantly improved solutions

### Areas for Further Exploration
- **Error Handling Strategies**: Define a comprehensive strategy for the MVP. What does the user see if code generation fails, the code is invalid, or execution times out? This must be defined before implementation.
- **Performance Optimization**: Caching strategies for repeated data analysis, visualization generation
- **Security Considerations**: **(High Priority)** The design and implementation of a secure code execution sandbox is the most critical risk. This includes preventing filesystem access, network calls, and other malicious activities. Input validation is secondary to the sandbox's integrity.
- **Styling and Branding**: Consistent visual design between data and visualization pages

### Recommended Follow-up Techniques
- **Assumption Reversal**: Challenge assumptions about user workflows to discover alternative interaction patterns
- **Role Playing**: Explore user experience from different stakeholder perspectives (technical vs non-technical users)
- **Constraint Mapping**: Deep dive into technical limitations and security requirements

### Questions That Emerged
- How should the system handle ambiguous data that could support multiple visualization types?
- What fallback mechanisms are needed when automatic chart selection fails?
- Should users be able to customize generated visualizations without coding?
- How can the system learn from user preferences to improve automatic selections?

### Next Session Planning
- **Suggested topics:** Technical implementation deep-dive, security and error handling strategies, advanced user experience features
- **Recommended timeframe:** 2-3 weeks after initial implementation begins
- **Preparation needed:** Initial prototype testing, user feedback collection, technical constraint documentation
