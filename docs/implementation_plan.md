Here is a "Tree of Thoughts Deep Dive" based on the brainstorming session results for the visualization feature.

### **Central Trunk: Implement a Python Code-Generating Visualization Feature**

This is the core goal. I will break this down into its primary components (branches) and explore the implementation paths for each.

---

### **Branch 1: User Interface & Experience (UI/UX)**

*   **Thought 1.1 (High Confidence - Sure Path):** The two-page architecture is the best approach. It cleanly separates the existing SQL query functionality from the new visualization feature. This avoids cluttering the main interface and simplifies the user flow.
    *   **Action:** Create a new `visualization.html` page. Add a navigation link (e.g., in a navbar) from the main `index.html` to this new page.

*   **Thought 1.2 (High Confidence - Sure Path):** The controls on the visualization page should be static and clear, offering two distinct modes of operation as identified in the brainstorming.
    *   **Sub-Thought 1.2.1 (Auto-Generation):** An "Auto Generate" button. This is for users who want a quick, intelligent visualization without writing a prompt. It implies a backend process that analyzes the data and makes a smart choice.
    *   **Sub-Thought 1.2.2 (Custom Generation):** A text input area and a "Send" button. This empowers users to ask for specific charts in natural language (e.g., "a bar chart of sales by country").
    *   **Action:** Add the static HTML elements: `<button id="auto-generate">`, `<textarea id="custom-prompt">`, `<button id="send-custom">`, and an `<img>` tag to display the result.

### **Branch 2: Backend Data Analysis**

*   **Thought 2.1 (High Confidence - Sure Path):** Before generating a visualization, the system must understand the data. The idea to use the pandas library is optimal.
    *   **Action:** When the backend receives data from a SQL query, it should load it into a pandas DataFrame.

*   **Thought 2.2 (High Confidence - Sure Path):** The initial analysis should use standard, powerful pandas functions.
    *   **Sub-Thought 2.2.1:** Use `df.info()` to get column data types (e.g., numeric, object, datetime) and check for null values.
    *   **Sub-Thought 2.2.2:** Use `df.describe()` to get a statistical summary of all numerical columns (mean, std, min, max, etc.).
    *   **Action:** Create a Python function that takes a DataFrame and returns a structured summary of its properties.

*   **Thought 2.3 (Medium Confidence - Likely Path):** This analysis summary is the key input for the "Auto Generate" feature. A simple rules-based system can be built on top of it.
    *   **Example Rule 1:** If `df.info()` shows a `datetime` column and a numeric column, the suggested chart is a `line chart`.
    *   **Example Rule 2:** If there is one categorical column (object/string) and one numeric column, the suggested chart is a `bar chart`.
    *   **Example Rule 3:** If there are two numeric columns, the suggested chart is a `scatter plot`.
    *   **Action:** Develop a function that takes the data summary and outputs a string recommendation for a chart type.

### **Branch 3: AI Code Generation (GPT-5)**

*   **Thought 3.1 (High Confidence - Sure Path):** The core of this feature relies on generating Python code. A robust prompt template is non-negotiable for getting reliable, consistent results from GPT-5.
    *   **Action:** Design a detailed prompt template. It must include:
        1.  **Context:** "You are a data visualization expert. Your task is to write a Python script."
        2.  **Data Schema:** The column names and data types from `df.info()`.
        3.  **Task:** The chart type requested (either from the rules engine in Branch 2 or the user's custom prompt from Branch 1).
        4.  **Constraints:** "Use the `matplotlib` library. Save the output to a file named `visualization.png`. Do not use any other libraries. Do not write any text, only Python code."
        5.  **Data:** Provide the head of the dataframe `df.head().to_csv()` as an example of the data.

### **Branch 4: Secure Code Execution**

*   **Thought 4.1 (CRITICAL - High Risk):** Executing AI-generated code is inherently dangerous. The document correctly identifies that even for a single user, a secure sandbox is the most critical and challenging part of this project.
    *   **Sub-Thought 4.1.1 (Best Practice - Likely Path):** Use **Docker containers**. This is the industry-standard solution. The process would be:
        1.  Spin up a minimal Python container for each request.
        2.  Copy the generated Python script and the data (as a CSV) into the container.
        3.  Execute the script inside the isolated container.
        4.  Copy the resulting `visualization.png` out of the container.
        5.  Destroy the container.
        This prevents the code from accessing the host filesystem, network, or other sensitive resources.
    *   **Sub-Thought 4.1.2 (Alternative - Lower Security):** Use `subprocess` to run the code in a separate process with restricted permissions. This is harder to secure correctly than Docker. Given the project context, this might be considered, but Docker is strongly preferred.
    *   **Action:** Prioritize the design and implementation of a secure, sandboxed execution environment.

### **Final Synthesis (The Unified Plan)**

1.  **Frontend:** Build the `visualization.html` page with its static controls.
2.  **Backend API:** Create a new endpoint (e.g., `/generate_visualization`) that handles requests from the new page.
3.  **Analysis Pipeline:** When a request is received, load the data into pandas and run the analysis function (`info()`, `describe()`).
4.  **Logic Flow:**
    *   If it's an "Auto Generate" request, use the rules engine to pick a chart type.
    *   If it's a "Custom" request, use the user's text.
5.  **Prompt & Generation:** Pass the analysis summary and the request to the prompt template to build the final prompt for GPT-5. Call the API to get the Python code.
6.  **Execution:** Send the generated code and the data to the secure sandbox for execution.
7.  **Response:** Retrieve the `visualization.png` from the sandbox and send its path back to the frontend.
8.  **Display:** The frontend JavaScript updates the `<img>` tag's `src` to display the new chart.

This deep dive confirms that the path outlined in the brainstorming session is sound, logical, and addresses the key technical challenges, with the **secure code execution sandbox** being the highest priority and most complex task.
